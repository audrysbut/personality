      "The first and most important function for the INFP is introverted feeling. This isn’t exactly internal emotions (since all feelings are internal), but is instead best described as the moral values or judgments derived from inner understanding. Indeed, INFPs are often obsessed with their own emotional values and decisions; they tend to fixate on their gut instinct. However, since this is a feeling function, many INFPs are also quite considerate of the emotions of others. They often spend lots of time mulling over their feelings to make sure that they don’t hurt the emotions of other people.",
      "This function has the side effect of inspiring the INFP to value authenticity especially highly. As a result, INFPs are particularly repulsed by anything that seems like a lie or fabrication.",

      "INFPs practice extroverted intuition as they take in information. In a nutshell, they use this function to locate and connect various patterns among data points are people. They look at things in a broad way and can often see symbols or patterns where others can’t. As a result, INFPs are much more extending and concepts and big ideas than surface-level or concrete data. Ne being extroverted also means that the INFP will most often be focused on outside things rather than using their intuition on their inner world.",

      "The third function for the INFP is introverted sensing. This helps INFPs ground their ideas and feelings in the real world based on tactile information or sensations. It also helps the INFP feel like many of their moral values are grounded; they seem to have a real-world sense of right or wrong even if they can’t touch it with their hands.",
      "Because this sensing function is introverted, most of this perception comes from personal experience or memories. Real-world events can impact an INFP for a long time after the event has concluded, and INFPs rarely forget people are things that affected them emotionally.",

      "The fourth and least developed cognitive function for INFPs is extroverted thinking. This inferior function is normally very logic-oriented, and it helps INFPs occasionally find efficient ways to complete their goals or refine their work so far. However, INFPs naturally only use this function when all other avenues are exhausted. They also find thinking this way constantly to be very tiring or annoying, as it can feel robotic and inauthentic compared to their rich inner emotional lives.",

      "This second shadow function lies in opposition to the extroverted intuition the INFP relies on more often. This inner function isn’t very well-developed in INFPs, so they often use it in a relatively confused manner. It manifests as patterns that aren’t really there or gut feelings that are incorrect once investigated. This can then lead the INFP to doubt their gut feelings altogether, which drives them into a spiral of bad feelings and self-nagging.",

INFPs use this underdeveloped function when they aren’t very well aware of their surroundings or when they forget details. INFPs are famously forgetful, particularly when given tasks that could become boring to the rich inner world they would much rather spend their time in. It can also manifest as an INFP for treating into their mind for hours or days on end.",

      "This shadow function is the least developed for the INFP, so it’s the one they have the least control over even if all shadow functions operate in the subconscious. Ti, in this case, manifests as INFPs becoming obsessed with making things cold or overly logical. They may try to define or redefine various terms, particularly relative to their own goals for authentic selves. They will often seek perfection when in the grip of Ti, becoming increasingly self-critical and berating themselves ceaselessly over their failures.",

      "The INFP’s most dominant shadow function is an extroverted version of their prime cognitive driver. This is focused on emotions relative to the outside world. It helps INFPs understand the emotions of others, but can also be expressed when the INFPs lashes out. As such, when triggered, INFPs can be particularly harsh critics and attack people “where it hurts most”.",
      "Additionally, INFPs normally don’t trust the expression of this function in other people. As it’s focused on understanding the emotions of others, INFPs can easily see it as inauthentic or fake. At worst, they may describe it as manipulative.",
