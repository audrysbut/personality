When this personality type experiences their shadow function, that completely shifts and now the INTP can become less understanding and even more irritable.",

However, with this function, this personality type begins to question and go against their established values. It becomes destructive when they not only begin to blame themselves but begin to take out their negativity on others.",

These patterns are utilized to then form educated decisions or assumptions.",

They like to see all sides to an argument or topic which allows them to remain open-minded especially in tricky situations. Most of the time, this is a great quality to have, although there are times where being open-minded and wanting to see all perspectives can be difficult.
