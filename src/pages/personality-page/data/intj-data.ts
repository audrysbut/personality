INTJs spend a lot of time considering their plans and looking at potential goals.",

Since INTJs have this extraverted thinking skill, they enjoy formulating their decisions using logic.

However, when INTJs are unhealthy, they can start ignoring what’s happened in the past, and then lose track of their ability to combine patterns and understand the future.",
